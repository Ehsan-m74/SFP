#Fiber Connectors Usage
| Name | Usage | 
|---|---|
| LC | SFP |
| SC | GBIC |
| ST | Used in fiber distribution frame; For 10Base-F connections, the connector is usually ST type | 
| FC | Generally used on the ODF side |
| MPO | Used in high density cabling environments like data centers |
| MTP | Used in high density cabling environments like data centers |

###10BASE-F, or sometimes 10BASE-FX, is a generic term for the family of 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standards using fiber optic cable. In 10BASE-F, the 10 represents a maximum throughput of 10 Mbit/s, BASE indicates its use of baseband transmission, and F indicates that it relies on medium of fiber-optic cable. 

###ODF: Optical Distribution Frame 

###Simplex vs. Duplex: A connector by itself is simplex while a pair of connectors together is duplex. Duplex is the more common of the two since fiber cables are typically used in pairs.

###MTP is a brand name for an MPO connector manufactured by US Conec.. The MTP connector is a high performance MPO connector engineered for better mechanical and optical performance.
