# SFP

### Connector Usage

| Type | Usage |
|---|---|
| LC | SFP |
| SC | GBIC |  
| ST | Fiber distribution frame and 10Base-F connections |  
| FC | Generally used on the ODF side (the most used on the patch panel) | 
| MPO | Used in high density cabling environments like data centers |  
| MPT | Used in high density cabling environments like data centers |  

*10BASE-F, or sometimes 10BASE-FX, is a generic term for the family of 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standards using fiber optic cable. In 10BASE-F, the 10 represents a maximum throughput of 10 Mbit/s, BASE indicates its use of baseband transmission, and F indicates that it relies on medium of fiber-optic cable

*The MTP connector, a registered trade mark of US Conec. The MTP connector is a high performance MPO connector engineered for better mechanical and optical performance.

*Simplex vs. Duplex : A connector by itself is simplex while a pair of connectors together is duplex. Duplex is the more common of the two since fiber cables are typically used in pairs
